# Problem Statement: Revenue Prediction for Foam Factory

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to predict the revenue generated by foam factories based on daily production and operational parameters.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this task is `FoamFactory_V2_27K.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- **Factory**: Identifier for the factory.
- **Date**: The date of the recorded data.
- **Location**: The geographical location of the factory.
- **Machine Type**: The type of machine used in production.
- **Machine Utilization (%)**: Percentage of time the machine is actively used.
- **Machine Downtime (hours)**: Hours the machine was non-operational.
- **Maintenance History**: Maintenance status of the machine.
- **Machine Age (years)**: Age of the machine in years.
- **Batch**: Identifier for the production batch.
- **Batch Quality (Pass %)**: Percentage of products in the batch that passed quality checks.
- **Cycle Time (minutes)**: Time taken to complete one production cycle.
- **Energy Consumption (kWh)**: Energy consumed during production.
- **Energy Efficiency Rating**: Rating of the machine's energy efficiency.
- **CO2 Emissions (kg)**: Amount of CO2 emitted during production.
- **Emission Limit Compliance**: Whether the emissions comply with limits.
- **Waste Generated (kg)**: Amount of waste produced during production.
- **Water Usage (liters)**: Amount of water used during production.
- **Shift**: The shift during which the production occurred.
- **Operator Experience (years)**: Average experience of operators.
- **Team Size**: Number of team members involved in production.
- **Team Members**: Detailed information about each team member.
- **Operator Training Level**: Average training level of operators.
- **Absenteeism Rate (%)**: Percentage of absenteeism among operators.
- **Product Category**: Category of the product being produced.
- **Supplier**: Supplier of raw materials.
- **Supplier Delays (days)**: Delays caused by the supplier.
- **Raw Material Quality**: Quality of raw materials used.
- **Market Demand Index**: Index representing market demand for the product.
- **Cost of Downtime ($)**: Financial cost of machine downtime.
- **Revenue ($)**: Revenue generated from the production batch.
- **Profit Margin (%)**: Profit margin for the batch.
- **Breakdowns (count)**: Number of machine breakdowns.
- **Safety Incidents (count)**: Number of safety incidents during production.
- **Production Volume (units)**: Total units produced in the batch.
- **Defect Rate (%)**: Percentage of defective products in the batch.
- **Temperature (C)**: Temperature during production.
- **Pressure (psi)**: Pressure during production.
- **Chemical Ratio**: Ratio of chemicals used in production.
- **Mixing Speed (RPM)**: Speed at which materials are mixed.

## Target Variable
- **Revenue ($)**: The revenue generated from the production batch.

## Features
All other columns listed above will be used as features for the model.

## Goal
The goal is to build a predictive model that accurately estimates the revenue based on the given features. The model will help in optimizing production processes, improving resource allocation, and maximizing revenue.
